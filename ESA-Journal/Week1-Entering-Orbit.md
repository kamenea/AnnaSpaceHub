## Week 1 - Entering Orbit

> "Journey into the unknown, but for the first time in a long time, I feel excited."

This week I made a choice: not just to explore ESA as a career, but to believe it's possible.
I outlined my roadmap, picked my journaling tool, and began building the structure for my portfolio. I don't know where I'll land - but I'm finally moving.

## Micro-Wins:
- Defined my GitHub layout and began AnnaSpaceHub repo
- Chose Reflection for personal journaling

## Next Steps:
- Begin weekly journal updates
- Curate older GitHub projects for relevance and tagging

I'm proud of the shift, and I'm ready to keep walking.
