# 👩‍🚀 Anna S. | Space Systems Explorer 🚀🌌
Hi, I'm Anna - a software designer and AI enthusiast with strong background in fintech, now setting my sights on space technology. 
Preparing for a future in space systems and autonomous technologies. This portfolio documents my journey as I deepen my skills, explore ESA-aligned projects. I'm exploring how AI, software engineering, and curiosity can meet mission-grade systems.
This portfolio documents my journey: learning, experimenting, and dreaming big.
